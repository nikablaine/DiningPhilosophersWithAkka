# CodingDevelopersWithAkka

The first attempt to solve Dining Philosophers problem using Scala together with Akka framework.
To make solution funnier I transformed the philosophers to developers, and "thinking" to the "coding".

The solution is based on having actor for every developer and one actor for the waiter, who is managing the forks.
